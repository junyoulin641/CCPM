# Task: Implement Application Entry Point and Event Handlers

## Description
Create the main.py entry point that initializes the QApplication and launches the main window. Implement event handler methods for all button actions (process, validate, clear) and connect button signals to their respective handlers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] main.py file created in project root
- [ ] main() function initializes QApplication and MainWindow
- [ ] Application runs and displays window when main.py is executed
- [ ] handle_process() method implemented (prints input to console, transforms text)
- [ ] handle_validate() method implemented (validates non-empty input)
- [ ] handle_clear() method implemented (resets input field)
- [ ] All button click signals connected to handler methods
- [ ] Console output visible for process and validate actions
- [ ] Application exits cleanly when window is closed

## Acceptance Criteria (Continued)
- [ ] Error handling for empty input in validate handler
- [ ] Code includes docstrings for main() function

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**

**main.py structure:**
```python
import sys
from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication
from ui.main_window import MainWindow

def main():
    """Initialize and run the PyQt6 application."""
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = MainWindow()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Event Handler Methods (in MainWindow class):**
- `handle_process(self)`:
  - Get text from input_field
  - Print original text to console
  - Transform text (e.g., uppercase, reverse, character count)
  - Print transformed text to console

- `handle_validate(self)`:
  - Get text from input_field
  - Check if non-empty
  - Print validation result to console
  - Optional: Check for specific format/pattern

- `handle_clear(self)`:
  - Clear input_field text
  - Print "Input cleared" to console

**Signal Connections (in MainWindow.__init__ or connect_signals method):**
```python
self.process_btn.clicked.connect(self.handle_process)
self.validate_btn.clicked.connect(self.handle_validate)
self.clear_btn.clicked.connect(self.handle_clear)
```

**Files to Modify:**
- Create: `main.py` - Application entry point
- Modify: `ui/main_window.py` - Add event handler methods and signal connections

**Key Considerations:**
- Use sys.exit(app.exec()) for proper application termination
- Print clear, descriptive messages to console for each action
- Handle edge cases (empty input, special characters)
- Keep handlers simple and focused on single responsibility

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 4 completed (MainWindow class exists)
- [ ] PyQt6 installed and importable

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2.5 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on task 4)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] main.py successfully launches application
- [ ] Window appears with all widgets visible
- [ ] Process button prints and transforms input
- [ ] Validate button checks input and provides feedback
- [ ] Clear button resets input field
- [ ] Console output is clear and descriptive
- [ ] Application exits without errors or warnings
- [ ] Code reviewed for PEP 8 compliance
