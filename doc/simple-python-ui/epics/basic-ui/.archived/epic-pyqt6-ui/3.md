# Task: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Description
Create the foundational project structure, dependencies file, and basic documentation for the PyQt6 UI application. This task establishes the development environment and ensures all necessary dependencies are properly specified.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project directory structure created with ui/ subdirectory
- [ ] requirements.txt file created with PyQt6 dependency specification
- [ ] Basic README.md created with installation and run instructions
- [ ] Project structure follows Python best practices
- [ ] All files use correct Python/text encoding

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Create main project directory structure:
  ```
  simple-python-ui/
  ├── ui/
  ├── requirements.txt
  └── README.md
  ```
- requirements.txt should specify: `PyQt6>=6.0.0`
- README.md should include:
  - Project description
  - Installation instructions (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
  - Basic run instructions (will be updated when main.py exists)
  - Python version requirement (3.8+)

**Files to Create:**
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `ui/` directory - For UI module files

**Key Considerations:**
- Keep directory structure simple and flat
- Use clear, concise documentation
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows primary, but portable paths)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed (external prerequisite)
- [ ] pip available (external prerequisite)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5 hours
- Parallel: true (can run independently of other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Directory structure created and verified
- [ ] requirements.txt contains PyQt6 dependency
- [ ] README.md has installation and setup instructions
- [ ] Files committed to version control (if using git)
- [ ] Teammate can follow README to set up environment
