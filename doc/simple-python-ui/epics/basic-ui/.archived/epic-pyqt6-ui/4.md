# Task: Implement Main Window Class and UI Structure

## Description
Create the MainWindow class in ui/main_window.py that defines the single-window interface with input field, label, and action buttons. Implement the layout using QVBoxLayout and ensure proper widget organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ui/main_window.py file created with MainWindow class
- [ ] MainWindow inherits from QMainWindow
- [ ] Window has title "Simple PyQt6 UI" and reasonable default size (400x200)
- [ ] QLabel widget created with text "Enter text:"
- [ ] QLineEdit widget created for text input
- [ ] Three QPushButton widgets created: "Process", "Validate", "Clear"
- [ ] QVBoxLayout arranges widgets vertically with proper spacing
- [ ] Buttons arranged in QHBoxLayout for horizontal alignment
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines

## Technical Details
**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `ui/main_window.py` with MainWindow class
- Key methods to implement:
  - `__init__(self)`: Initialize window and call setup methods
  - `init_ui(self)`: Configure window properties (title, size, central widget)
  - `create_widgets(self)`: Instantiate all UI widgets
  - `setup_layout(self)`: Arrange widgets using layouts

**Widget Configuration:**
- QLabel: Plain text label with "Enter text:"
- QLineEdit: Single-line input, placeholder text optional
- QPushButton widgets: "Process", "Validate", "Clear" labels
- QVBoxLayout: 10px margins, 10px spacing
- QHBoxLayout for buttons: center alignment

**Files to Create:**
- `ui/__init__.py` - Empty file to make ui a package
- `ui/main_window.py` - MainWindow class implementation

**Key Considerations:**
- Keep widget creation separate from layout setup for clarity
- Store widget references as instance variables (self.input_field, etc.)
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add inline comments for non-obvious layout configurations

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 3 completed (project structure exists)
- [ ] PyQt6 installed (external dependency)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on task 3)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MainWindow class implemented with all required methods
- [ ] All widgets created and properly configured
- [ ] Layout arranges components logically
- [ ] Code is PEP 8 compliant
- [ ] Inline comments explain layout structure
- [ ] Window can be instantiated without errors (tested in next task)
