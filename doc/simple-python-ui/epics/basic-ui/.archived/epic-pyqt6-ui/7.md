# Task: Documentation and Code Comments

## Description
Add comprehensive inline code comments and update README.md with complete usage instructions, examples, and troubleshooting guidance. Ensure the codebase is well-documented for developers who want to learn from or extend the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All classes have docstrings explaining purpose and usage
- [ ] All methods have docstrings with parameter and return descriptions
- [ ] Complex code sections have inline comments explaining logic
- [ ] README.md updated with complete installation instructions
- [ ] README.md includes usage examples with expected output
- [ ] README.md has troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Code examples in README are tested and accurate
- [ ] README includes project overview and features list
- [ ] Optional: Add requirements.txt comments explaining dependencies

## Technical Details
**Code Documentation to Add:**

**main.py:**
- Module-level docstring explaining application purpose
- main() function docstring with usage example

**ui/main_window.py:**
- Class docstring for MainWindow
- Method docstrings for:
  - `__init__`: Initialization purpose
  - `init_ui`: Window configuration details
  - `create_widgets`: Widget creation purpose
  - `setup_layout`: Layout strategy explanation
  - `handle_process`: What processing is performed
  - `handle_validate`: Validation rules
  - `handle_clear`: Clear behavior

- Inline comments for:
  - Layout configuration (margins, spacing)
  - Widget connections
  - Non-obvious logic in handlers

**README.md Structure:**
```markdown
# Simple PyQt6 UI

## Overview
Brief description of the application and its purpose.

## Features
- Single-window interface
- Text input field
- Process, Validate, and Clear buttons
- Console feedback for all actions

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyQt6

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Run the application:
```
python main.py
```

### Using the Application
1. Enter text in the input field
2. Click "Process" to transform and print the text
3. Click "Validate" to check if input is non-empty
4. Click "Clear" to reset the input field

### Expected Output
Console output examples for each action.

## Project Structure
```
simple-python-ui/
├── main.py              # Application entry point
├── ui/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── main_window.py   # Main window class
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Troubleshooting
- **PyQt6 import error**: Run `pip install PyQt6`
- **Application doesn't launch**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- **Window doesn't appear**: Check console for error messages

## Extending the Application
Tips for developers who want to modify or extend the code.

**Files to Modify:**
- `main.py` - Add module and function docstrings
- `ui/main_window.py` - Add class, method docstrings, and inline comments
- `README.md` - Complete documentation with examples
- `requirements.txt` - Optional inline comments

**Key Considerations:**
- Keep docstrings concise but informative
- Use clear, simple language
- Include examples in README that match actual application behavior
- Test all commands in README to ensure accuracy
- Consider target audience (Python developers learning PyQt6)

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 5 completed (code implementation finished)
- [x] Task 6 completed (testing verified behavior for documentation)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1.5 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on tasks 5 and 6)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All classes and methods have docstrings
- [ ] Complex code has inline comments
- [ ] README.md has complete installation instructions
- [ ] README.md has usage examples with expected output
- [ ] README.md has troubleshooting section
- [ ] All documentation is accurate and tested
- [ ] Code is readable and self-documenting
- [ ] New developer can understand code in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity and completeness
