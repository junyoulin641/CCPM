# Task: Manual Testing and Quality Assurance

## Description
Perform comprehensive manual testing of the PyQt6 application to verify all functional requirements are met. Test various input scenarios, button interactions, and edge cases. Verify performance requirements and cross-platform compatibility (Windows primary).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application launches in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Window displays correctly with all widgets visible and aligned
- [ ] Input field accepts text entry (normal, empty, special characters)
- [ ] Process button works with various inputs (empty, normal, long text, special chars)
- [ ] Validate button correctly identifies empty vs non-empty input
- [ ] Clear button resets input field to empty state
- [ ] Console output is visible and correct for all actions
- [ ] Button responses feel instantaneous (< 100ms)
- [ ] No crashes or errors during 30 minutes of continuous interaction
- [ ] Window controls (minimize, maximize, close) function properly
- [ ] Application exits cleanly without hanging processes

## Technical Details
**Test Scenarios to Execute:**

**1. Application Launch Testing:**
- Launch from command line: `python main.py`
- Verify window appears within 2 seconds
- Check window title is "Simple PyQt6 UI"
- Verify window size is approximately 400x200 pixels
- Confirm all widgets are visible and properly aligned

**2. Input Field Testing:**
- Enter normal text (e.g., "Hello World")
- Enter empty string
- Enter special characters (!@#$%^&*)
- Enter very long text (500+ characters)
- Enter unicode characters (emoji, accented letters)
- Verify text displays correctly in input field

**3. Process Button Testing:**
- Click with empty input
- Click with normal text
- Verify console output shows original text
- Verify console output shows transformed text
- Test multiple consecutive clicks
- Verify button visual feedback (press animation)

**4. Validate Button Testing:**
- Click with empty input (should fail validation)
- Click with non-empty input (should pass validation)
- Verify console feedback is clear
- Test edge cases (whitespace-only input)

**5. Clear Button Testing:**
- Enter text and click Clear
- Verify input field is empty
- Verify console shows "Input cleared" message
- Click Clear on already empty field

**6. Performance Testing:**
- Measure launch time (should be < 2 seconds)
- Test button responsiveness (should feel instant)
- Run application for 30 minutes with periodic interactions
- Monitor for memory leaks or slowdowns

**7. Cross-Platform Testing (Optional):**
- Test on Windows (primary)
- If available, test on Linux or macOS
- Document any platform-specific issues

**Files to Review:**
- `main.py` - Entry point code
- `ui/main_window.py` - MainWindow implementation
- Console output during testing

**Key Considerations:**
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Document any bugs or issues found
- Verify all acceptance criteria from PRD
- Check code quality (readability, comments, PEP 8)

## Dependencies
- [x] Task 5 completed (application fully implemented)
- [ ] Python and PyQt6 installed
- [ ] Windows test environment available

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on task 5)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test scenarios executed and documented
- [ ] No critical bugs found (or all bugs fixed)
- [ ] Performance requirements met (launch < 2s, buttons < 100ms)
- [ ] Application stable for 30+ minutes of use
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified (Windows minimum)
- [ ] Test results documented (can be simple checklist)
- [ ] Code reviewed for quality and PEP 8 compliance
- [ ] Any issues found are either fixed or documented as known limitations
