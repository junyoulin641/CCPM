# Task: Manual hardware testing (Arduino/ESP32)

## Description
Perform comprehensive manual testing of the UARTWidget with real hardware (Arduino Uno/Nano or ESP32). Test all core functionality at multiple baud rates using the example sketches. Verify all success criteria from the PRD are met with physical devices. Document any hardware-specific issues or compatibility notes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tested with Arduino Uno/Nano at 9600, 115200, 921600 baud
- [ ] Tested with ESP32 at 115200 baud (if available)
- [ ] Port enumeration shows connected device
- [ ] Connect/disconnect cycle works reliably
- [ ] Data sent from UI appears on device correctly (verified via echo)
- [ ] Data from device displays correctly in RX area
- [ ] Command-response protocol works (ping_pong sketch)
- [ ] Continuous streaming works (stream_logger sketch)
- [ ] Hot unplug handled gracefully
- [ ] Reconnect works after unplug
- [ ] All PRD success criteria verified with hardware

## Technical Details
**Test scenarios:**
1. **Basic connection test:**
   - Connect at 115200 baud
   - Verify connection established
   - Disconnect cleanly

2. **Echo test (bidirectional communication):**
   - Upload echo_uart.ino
   - Send text from UI
   - Verify exact echo received in RX area

3. **Command-response test:**
   - Upload ping_pong.ino
   - Send "PING" command
   - Verify "PONG" response appears

4. **Continuous streaming test:**
   - Upload stream_logger.ino
   - Observe 10 messages/second display
   - Verify UI remains responsive
   - Check for message loss (counter gaps)

5. **Hot unplug test:**
   - Connect and start receiving data
   - Physically unplug device during operation
   - Verify error message displayed
   - Verify UI doesn't crash
   - Reconnect and verify operation resumes

6. **Baud rate test:**
   - Test at 9600, 115200, 921600 baud
   - Verify communication at each rate
   - Note any issues at high baud rates

**Key considerations:**
- Test on both Windows and Linux if possible
- Document any driver issues (CH340, CP2102, etc.)
- Note maximum reliable baud rate for each device
- Verify USB-serial chip compatibility

**Code locations/files affected:**
- Testing only (no code changes expected)
- Document results in testing notes

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 22: Basic functionality testing complete
- [ ] Task 30: echo_uart.ino sketch complete
- [ ] Task 31: ping_pong.ino sketch complete
- [ ] Task 32: stream_logger.ino sketch complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on 22, 30, 31, 32)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test scenarios executed
- [ ] Results documented for each scenario
- [ ] All PRD success criteria verified
- [ ] Hardware compatibility notes recorded
- [ ] Any bugs or issues filed
- [ ] Testing notes committed to repository
