# Task: Create uart_widget.py module structure

## Description
Create the foundational module structure for the UARTWidget component. This includes setting up the main UARTWidget class (inheriting from QWidget), basic file organization, and module imports. This is the scaffolding task that all subsequent UI and logic tasks will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File `uart_widget.py` created in appropriate location (e.g., `simple-python-ui/ui/`)
- [ ] UARTWidget class defined, inheriting from QWidget
- [ ] Basic imports added (PyQt6.QtWidgets, PyQt6.QtCore, collections, datetime)
- [ ] Class constructor `__init__()` defined with super() call
- [ ] Module is importable without errors
- [ ] Basic docstring added describing the widget's purpose

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Create file in `simple-python-ui/ui/uart_widget.py` (or appropriate UI directory)
- Import necessary PyQt6 modules:
  - `from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout`
  - `from PyQt6.QtCore import QThread, pyqtSignal, pyqtSlot, QObject`
- Import Python standard library:
  - `from collections import deque`
  - `from datetime import datetime`
- Define UARTWidget class with basic structure

**Key considerations:**
- Keep imports minimal at this stage (add more as needed in later tasks)
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
- Add placeholder for future SerialWorker class (can be in same file or separate)

**Code locations/files affected:**
- New file: `uart_widget.py`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Python 3.10+ environment set up
- [ ] PyQt6 installed (existing project dependency)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5 hours
- Parallel: true (can run independently)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Module imports successfully
- [ ] Class structure follows PyQt6 widget pattern
- [ ] No syntax errors or import issues
