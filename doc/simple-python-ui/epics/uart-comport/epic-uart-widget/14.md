# Task: Implement data display panel (UI)

## Description
Create the main data display panel featuring a QTextEdit widget for showing received (RX) and transmitted (TX) data. Include controls for auto-scrolling behavior and clearing the buffer. This is the primary visual component where users monitor serial communication in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] QTextEdit widget created and configured as read-only
- [ ] Auto-scroll QCheckBox added with "Auto-scroll" label
- [ ] Clear buffer QPushButton added with "Clear" label
- [ ] Widgets arranged in vertical layout
- [ ] Auto-scroll checkbox is checked by default
- [ ] Clear button triggers buffer clear action (handler can be placeholder)
- [ ] Display panel properly expands to fill available space

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Add QTextEdit widget to UARTWidget layout (from task 001)
- Configure as read-only: `self.data_display.setReadOnly(True)`
- Create horizontal layout for controls below display
- Add QCheckBox for auto-scroll feature
- Add QPushButton for clear functionality
- Set size policies for proper layout expansion

**Key considerations:**
- QTextEdit should expand vertically (use `QSizePolicy.Expanding`)
- Auto-scroll checkbox default state: checked
- Clear button should be clearly visible but not dominate the layout
- Consider adding placeholder text to QTextEdit (e.g., "No data received...")

**Code locations/files affected:**
- Modify: `uart_widget.py` (UARTWidget.__init__)
- Methods to add: `clear_display()` (can be placeholder for now)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (module structure exists)
- [ ] PyQt6.QtWidgets available (QTextEdit, QCheckBox, QPushButton)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2 hours
- Parallel: false (conflicts with tasks 005 and 007 due to layout modifications)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] QTextEdit displays correctly in widget
- [ ] Auto-scroll checkbox functional (connects to handler)
- [ ] Clear button functional (connects to handler)
- [ ] Layout renders correctly when widget is resized
- [ ] No UI rendering errors
