# Task: Add PySerial to requirements and verify installation

## Description
Add PySerial library to project dependencies (requirements.txt or pyproject.toml) and verify successful installation. Document the required version and ensure it's compatible with Python 3.10+.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PySerial added to requirements.txt (or pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Version specified (e.g., `pyserial>=3.5`)
- [ ] Library installs successfully via pip
- [ ] Import test passes: `import serial` and `import serial.tools.list_ports`
- [ ] README or setup documentation updated with installation instructions

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Add to `requirements.txt`:
  ```
  pyserial>=3.5
  ```
- Or if using pyproject.toml:
  ```toml
  dependencies = [
      "pyserial>=3.5"
  ]
  ```
- Run installation test:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -c "import serial; print(serial.VERSION)"
  ```

**Key considerations:**
- Use `pyserial` (NOT `serial`) in requirements
- Version 3.5+ is stable and supports Python 3.10+
- Document any platform-specific notes (Windows/macOS/Linux all supported)

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
- Optional: `README.md` (installation section)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Project uses requirements.txt or pyproject.toml for dependency management

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25 hours
- Parallel: true (independent of other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Dependency added to requirements file
- [ ] Installation verified (pip install succeeds)
- [ ] Import test passes
- [ ] No version conflicts with existing dependencies
