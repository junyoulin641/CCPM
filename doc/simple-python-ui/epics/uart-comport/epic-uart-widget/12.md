# Task: Create example firmware directory structure

## Description
Set up directory structure for Arduino example firmware sketches. Create placeholder directories and basic README explaining the purpose of each example. This prepares the repository for firmware tasks that will create actual .ino files later.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory `examples/` created in project root (or appropriate location)
- [ ] Subdirectories created: `examples/echo_uart/`, `examples/ping_pong/`, `examples/stream_logger/`
- [ ] README.md created in `examples/` explaining purpose and usage
- [ ] Each subdirectory has a placeholder README describing what the sketch will do

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
```
simple-python-ui/
└── examples/
    ├── README.md
    ├── echo_uart/
    │   └── README.md
    ├── ping_pong/
    │   └── README.md
    └── stream_logger/
        └── README.md
```

**Main examples/README.md content:**
- Purpose: Testing and validation firmware for UART widget
- Hardware requirements: Arduino Uno/Nano or ESP32
- Upload instructions (brief)
- Reference to individual sketch READMEs

**Sketch-specific READMEs:**
- echo_uart: Echoes back received data (for TX/RX verification)
- ping_pong: Responds to "PING" with "PONG" (command-response testing)
- stream_logger: Periodic log output (continuous streaming test)

**Key considerations:**
- Keep structure simple (one .ino file per sketch directory)
- Document hardware compatibility (Arduino IDE vs PlatformIO)
- Explain baud rate settings in each README

**Code locations/files affected:**
- New directory: `examples/` and subdirectories
- New files: Multiple README.md files

## Dependencies
- [ ] Project repository structure allows examples/ directory

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5 hours
- Parallel: true (independent task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Directory structure created
- [ ] All READMEs written
- [ ] Documentation clear and helpful
- [ ] Ready for .ino files to be added in testing tasks
