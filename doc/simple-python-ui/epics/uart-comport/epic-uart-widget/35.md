# Task: Integrate UARTWidget into main window

## Description
Import and embed the completed UARTWidget into the main application window. Add it to the appropriate layout or tab structure in the main UI. Verify the widget functions correctly within the context of the full application, interacts properly with other UI components, and follows the application's overall design patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UARTWidget imported into main.py or main_window.py
- [ ] Widget added to main window layout (appropriate tab or panel)
- [ ] Widget displays correctly in application context
- [ ] All UARTWidget functionality works within main application
- [ ] Widget resizes properly with main window
- [ ] No import errors or dependency conflicts
- [ ] Widget follows application's overall style/theme
- [ ] Integration tested with full application startup/shutdown

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
```python
# In main.py or main_window.py
from ui.uart_widget import UARTWidget

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # ... existing setup ...

        # Add UART widget to appropriate location
        self.uart_widget = UARTWidget()

        # Option 1: Add to tab widget
        self.tab_widget.addTab(self.uart_widget, "UART Monitor")

        # Option 2: Add to dock widget
        uart_dock = QDockWidget("UART", self)
        uart_dock.setWidget(self.uart_widget)
        self.addDockWidget(Qt.DockWidgetArea.RightDockWidgetArea, uart_dock)

        # Option 3: Add to main layout
        self.main_layout.addWidget(self.uart_widget)
```

**Key considerations:**
- Choose appropriate integration point based on application design
- Ensure widget cleanup on application close (disconnect ports)
- Match application's existing style (fonts, colors, spacing)
- Consider whether widget should be closable/detachable
- Test with other application features active

**Code locations/files affected:**
- `main.py` or `main_window.py`: Add import and widget instantiation
- May need to update application's layout structure

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 9: Create uart_widget.py module structure complete
- [ ] Task 13: Create TX input area complete
- [ ] Task 14: Create RX display area complete
- [ ] Task 15: Create Send button complete
- [ ] Task 33: Manual hardware testing complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1 hour
- Parallel: false (depends on widget completion)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Widget appears in main application window
- [ ] All widget functionality works in integrated context
- [ ] Application starts and shuts down cleanly
- [ ] Widget follows application's design patterns
- [ ] Integration tested with main application workflow
- [ ] No regressions in existing application features
