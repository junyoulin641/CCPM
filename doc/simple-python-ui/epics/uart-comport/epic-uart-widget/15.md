# Task: Implement command input panel (UI)

## Description
Create the bottom command input panel allowing users to type commands and send them over the serial port. Includes a QLineEdit for text input and a Send button. The Enter key should trigger the send action for quick command entry.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] QLineEdit widget created for command input
- [ ] QPushButton created with "Send" label
- [ ] Widgets arranged in horizontal layout
- [ ] Enter key in QLineEdit triggers send action
- [ ] Send button triggers send action
- [ ] Input field clears after sending (behavior can be placeholder)
- [ ] Layout properly aligns input field and button

## Technical Details
**Implementation approach:**
- Add QLineEdit widget to UARTWidget layout (from task 001)
- Add QPushButton next to input field
- Create horizontal layout for input panel
- Connect QLineEdit.returnPressed signal to send handler
- Connect QPushButton.clicked signal to send handler
- Set input field to expand horizontally

**Key considerations:**
- QLineEdit should expand horizontally (button stays fixed width)
- Enter key support: connect `returnPressed` signal
- Both button click and Enter key should call same handler
- Placeholder text helpful: `setPlaceholderText("Enter command...")`
- Consider disabling input when port is not connected (future enhancement)

**Code locations/files affected:**
- Modify: `uart_widget.py` (UARTWidget.__init__)
- Methods to add: `send_command()` (can be placeholder for now)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (module structure exists)
- [ ] PyQt6.QtWidgets available (QLineEdit, QPushButton)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1 hour
- Parallel: false (conflicts with tasks 005 and 006 due to layout modifications)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] QLineEdit accepts text input
- [ ] Send button visible and clickable
- [ ] Enter key triggers send action
- [ ] Button click triggers send action
- [ ] Layout renders correctly when widget is resized
- [ ] No UI rendering errors
